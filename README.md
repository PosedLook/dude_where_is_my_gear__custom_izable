# Dude, Where's My Gear?!

A mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly GAMMA <br> <br>
*(may work for Vanilla Anomaly too but it is not fully supported)*

## Original Mod & Author
This [mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dude-wheres-my-gear) was originally made by [santii](https://www.moddb.com/members/santii90).
This is an expanded and updated version of it.

## Summary

This mod adds a unique twist to the game by introducing "penalties" for dying.
Unlike ironman, this mod doesn't require a full progress restart on death,
but provides punishments that make you take a similar approach, making it
more challenging and exciting.

## Main Features
- Almost entirely customizable with MCM. (Including custom and pre-build presets for easier handling of the many settings)

- Set your respawn point by various means.
- Lose items & money - and/or drop them at your death location (including exceptions for certain items).
- Customizable item degradation on death (condition, upgrades or even items broken into pieces).
- Punishments scaling with your rank
- Grace period after game start/after every death.
- Losing goodwill and rank
- Time passes after you are killed, the zone continues without you while you recover.
- After respawn health and satiety is modified according to customizable parameters.
