# Dude, Where's My Gear?!

A mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly

## Summary

This mod adds a unique twist to the game by introducing "penalties" for dying.
Unlike ironman, this mod doesn't require a full progress restart on death,
but provides punishments that make you take a similar approach, making it
more challenging and exciting.

## Features
- You need to sleep or create a stash to set a respawn point.
- If no respawn point set, you are sent back to your faction base.
- Time passes after you are killed, the zone continues without you while you recover.
- After respawn health and satiety is modified according to customizable parameters.
- Difficulty scaling based on current rank, it affects every % chance. 
    In early game, punishment chances are low. As you progress, these chances 
    will increase according to customizable scaling.
- Customizable item degradation on death
- Extremely customizable using MCM.
